# transformstorm: a python terminal application for playing games with langague models
![Screenshot](https://github.com/simonmnash/transformstorm/blob/main/assets/version_zero_screenshot.png)
This is a small interface built to wrap around and play with small language models. It will probably change/expand a bit as I learn more about curses.
It started as an adaptation of a game I was working on (https://gyre.itch.io/human-machine-rpg-authoring-tool).

The language model I built this interface for can be downloaded at
https://www.simonmnash.com/asset_files/200_word_rpg_model.tar.gz or https://gyre.itch.io/human-machine-rpg-authoring-tool

To run first clone the repo and install through `pip install -e .`, then download a model and extact it into a directory named "model".
Then, in the parent directory of model, run `transformstorm`.
